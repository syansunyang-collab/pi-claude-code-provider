# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0-fork.1] - 2026-10-09

Windows maintenance fork of the archived upstream 0.6.0, for Claude Code 2.1.292. See the README for differences, usage boundaries and the verified environment.

### Changed

- Images are sent inline as base64 blocks on stdin, directly after the transcript record that names them, instead of `@`-referenced files. Claude Code 2.1.292 silently drops `@`-referenced files over 256 KiB, so screenshots rarely reached the model, and each added image rewrote the cached prefix. Every occurrence now counts toward the image limits.
- The model picker offers full model ids (`claude-sonnet-5-5`, `claude-fable-5-1`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`) with Claude Code's own windows and output caps, instead of the aliases. The doctor names a picker id the alias no longer serves. Sessions saved with an alias id need a model reselected.

### Fixed

- Every request failed at the isolation check under Claude Code 2.1.292, which loads its built-in `plugin-authoring` plugin in print mode. It is now disabled alongside `agents-md` and `telemetry`.
- Summary requests that Pi marks `cacheRetention: "none"`, such as compaction, no longer write the whole prompt to the prompt cache.
- `npm run capture:claude-breakpoints`, the paid model matrix and every paid stage (`fable`, `opus`, `cache-haiku`, `cache-images`, `cache-images-haiku` and the live tests) select full model ids, which the picker offers.
- The doctor's context-window lookup type-checks against Pi's `ProviderModelConfig` union.

### Removed

- The session image store and per-request image leases, unused once images travel inline. On Linux and macOS, image directories left by earlier versions are still reclaimed by stale-directory recovery. Windows runs no stale-directory recovery, so such directories stay in the temporary directory until removed by hand after every earlier Pi process has exited.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-27

> **This project is mothballed after the release of v0.6.0.** Pi and Claude Code are both extremely fast-moving projects that publish breaking changes regularly, and this was a hobby project rather than a professional venture, so I have other plans for my time and my tokens. I encourage people to look for other providers, such as [pi-claude-bridge](https://github.com/elidickinson/pi-claude-bridge), which is built on the Agent SDK. Please do not report further issues or submit pull requests. If Pi and Claude Code stabilize in future months, I may revisit this project. I thank my users for their kind words and wish everyone good luck with their own efforts.

### Added

- The doctor and diagnostic report name the provider version Pi actually loaded and its install directory, so an older project-local or duplicate installation is visible.
- `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_WEB_SEARCH=off` leaves `pi_claude_code_provider_web_search` unregistered, so users with their own search tools or other providers' models no longer have Claude-backed search, or its prompt guidance, added to every session. The default stays `on`; an unrecognized value also leaves the tool unregistered, with a warning. The doctor and diagnostic report show the web-search state ([#15](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/15)).

### Fixed

- A request whose response a safety classifier flags no longer fails with "Claude emitted duplicate message_start". Claude Code re-ran such requests on a fallback model, such as Opus 4.8 for a flagged Fable 5.1 or Opus 5.5 response, which the provider cannot publish ([#5](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/5)).
- Refusals now fail as "The model refused to complete the request", naming the category and model when Claude Code reports them. Pi no longer retries them. Previously they were reported as retryable stream interruptions, so Pi re-sent a refused request up to three times.
- A second response that Claude Code starts on its own, through a recovery the provider does not specifically recognize, now fails as a retryable interruption instead of a protocol error that lost the turn. A mid-response switch by a managed fallback-model chain is recognized the same way.
- Private request and session image directories are now removed when Pi, or a pi-subagents runner, exits while a request is in flight, such as quitting mid-turn or stopping a background subagent. Previously they stayed until a later start's stale recovery at least an hour later, and on Windows indefinitely. A Claude process still shutting down at that moment is force-killed; state whose process liveness is unknown is still retained.
- On macOS, a Claude process that exits on its own just before the provider stops it, as after an output limit, no longer fails the request as a process-cleanup failure with retained private state.
- On Windows, a Claude Code descendant exiting while the provider stops the process tree no longer fails the request as "process liveness is unknown" with retained private state that Windows never reclaims.
- On Windows, a `.cmd` or `.bat` Claude Code shim now gets a clear error naming the fix instead of "not found on PATH" or `spawn EINVAL`.
- The private-path guard now also recognizes the temporary directory's alias spellings, such as macOS's `/var/folders` for `/private/var/folders` and Windows 8.3 short names, and ignores case on macOS.
- When Claude Code closes its input and exits before the prompt is written, such as after a failed login, requests now report Claude's own error or exit details instead of "Claude Code stdin failed: write EPIPE".
- A Claude process that exits right after starting no longer loses its output: the provider and web search now read stdout before recording process ownership, instead of after, when Node could already have discarded it. A fast failure previously surfaced as "omitted initialization" instead of Claude's own error.
- Capture cleanup terminates the owned POSIX process group even after its leader closes, preventing surviving descendants from outliving temporary capture files.
- A stalled response observer no longer retains private request files or session image leases after cancellation, process failure, or the total deadline, including when Claude has already exited. The deadline still starts at Claude launch and now covers response processing.
- Private-path checks reject equivalent paths into request and session image directories, including dot segments, relative paths, and Windows separator and case variations. The guard remains a heuristic rather than a filesystem sandbox.
- An omitted MCP prefix on exactly `bash`, `read`, `edit`, or `write` no longer fails the turn when that lowercase Pi tool is active. Capitalized names and other bare tool names remain errors; arguments are unchanged ([#14](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/14)).
- Local checkouts now show their directory name in Pi's `[Extensions]` list instead of `extensions`. The single root `index.ts` preserves Git and npm labels on both Pi distributions and replaces the previous entry shim.
- Provider tests wait for each request's own lifecycle metrics and isolate temporary state, preventing late cleanup from interfering with another test's assertions.

### Changed

- The pinned Claude Code settings now include `switchModelsOnFlag: false`, so a safety-classifier flag ends with the refusal instead of re-running the request on another model. Managed settings can still override it.
- Claude Code 2.1.283 is now the validated baseline; the minimum supported version remains 2.1.281. The quota-free stream-recovery captures are re-pinned to 2.1.283 and add refusal scenarios.
- The web-search tool's prompt guidance now tells models to use it only when no other web-search tool is available or the user asks for it, and its summary notes that it uses Claude subscription capacity.
- Claude Code's built-in telemetry plugin is explicitly disabled alongside the existing traffic-disable environment setting.
- Quota-free surface capture now reports startup plugins and pre-init records and verifies all Sonnet/Opus effort levels in the API request.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **Breaking.** Claude Code 2.1.281 is now the minimum supported version; update Claude Code (`claude update`) before or with this package. Older versions can still load, but are unsupported and flagged by the doctor.
- Pi 0.87.1 and Claude Code 2.1.281 are now the validated baseline; the minimum supported Pi version remains 0.86.1.
- Opus now uses its 1M context window on Pro, as on other plans, and its output limit rises to 128K, matching Claude Opus 5.5 in Claude Code.
- Long sessions can use their whole context window. The provider no longer refuses a request early by reserving the model's full output limit; Pi's own compaction runs at its usual threshold, and a context too large for the window comes back as "Prompt is too long", which Pi compacts and retries. A response cut off at the window now ends as a `length` stop Pi also recovers from, instead of an interruption error that Pi retried with the same oversized context.
- Claude Code no longer compacts the replayed conversation on its own (`DISABLE_COMPACT=1`); Pi owns compaction.

### Fixed

- Every request and web search no longer fails on Claude Code 2.1.281 with "Claude emitted a record before initialization" or "Claude Code loaded unexpected customizations". The provider now disables Claude Code's new built-in `agents-md` plugin ([#11](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/11), [#12](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/12), [#13](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/13)).
- The doctor names the model every alias is served, including Opus and Haiku, by reading only Claude Code's own alias table. An alias it cannot identify is reported as `undetermined` instead of `unavailable`.
- When `claude` is not on PATH, the provider now says so and names `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_PATH`, instead of reporting the executable as not runnable.
- A Pi session that outlives the Claude Code build it started with, after the updater removes that build, now reports "Claude Code at <path> no longer exists … run /reload" instead of a bare spawn ENOENT.
- Isolation and protocol-order failures now name what Claude Code loaded or emitted, such as `plugins: agents-md` or `system/commands_changed`, so a Claude Code release that adds one is diagnosable from the error alone.
- Tool and output-limit handoffs accept the provider's own POSIX termination signals after validation and cleanup, including SIGKILL escalation, instead of failing a completed response. Unexpected signal exits still fail ([#10](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/10)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- **Breaking.** Pi 0.86.1 is now the minimum supported version; upgrade Pi before this package. Older versions can still load, but are unsupported and flagged by the doctor. Pi 0.85.1 is no longer tested.
- Haiku no longer offers Pi effort levels or sends `--effort` to Claude Code. Claude Code may still use its default extended thinking even when Pi displays thinking as off.
- Claude Code 2.1.278 is now the validated baseline; the minimum supported version remains 2.1.270.
- Optional metrics log schema 5 counts image content blocks in `imageCount`, matching the 20-image limit rather than the number of stored files.

### Added

- `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_BORROW_SOLE_DIRECTORY=on` restores sole-session cwd borrowing for tool-bearing side requests without a recognized cwd. It is off by default because the borrowed directory may be wrong.
- The doctor now reports how the last request's directory was chosen, its prompt-cache reuse, and any mismatch between served and configured context windows.
- Maintainers can capture stream-recovery cases without quota using `npm run capture:claude-stream-recovery`; `test:paid:compat-npm` and `test:paid:compat-standalone` check both Pi distributions.

### Fixed

- Private runtime directory removal now retries brief filesystem conflicts before failing a completed request or leaving temporary state behind.
- Requests recover the current prompt and tools from Pi's transcript system messages, including later edits. Tool-call arguments follow Pi's JSON-compatible type.
- Parallel Pi sessions use their own working directories, image stores, and rate-limit notices. Ending one session no longer fails a request already running through another.
- Tool-bearing side requests without a registered session or recognized cwd now fail with `working_directory` instead of borrowing another session's directory. A tool-free request that gains tools in `before_provider_request` is also refused before launch.
- Image requests reject a temporary path containing a double quote before writing to the session image store; correcting the path lets the session continue.
- The doctor bridge probe reports an unsuccessful child exit and retains private state when process liveness is uncertain.
- Invalid timeout settings above Node's timer limit fail before launch instead of expiring almost immediately.
- Failed process-tree cleanup retains private state while a child may still be alive. Stale image recovery now makes progress even with more than 256 leftover stores.
- Quitting Pi during a turn no longer waits for Claude to finish. Its image directory remains available to the active request for deferred cleanup.
- New, resumed, forked, and cloned RPC sessions no longer report an extension error when Pi binds the session twice.
- Responses that reach the output limit keep their text and end with a `length` stop, including when Claude Code exits before the provider stops it.
- Other extensions can run their own agent loops or call `completeSimple` with this provider without exiting Pi; they use the same cwd routing rules.
- Thinking summaries are visible in Pi again. Set `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_THINKING_DISPLAY=omitted` to hide the text.
- Compaction and other one-shot summaries no longer write a prompt-cache entry they cannot reuse.
- Mid-response interruptions, including drops inside streamed tool arguments, are reported as retryable failures under Pi's retry settings. API errors take precedence over unfinished-block errors.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_TRANSCRIPT_BREAKPOINT=off` turns off the provider's prompt-cache marker. It is an escape hatch in case a future Claude Code release rejects requests for carrying too many cache markers; that error names this setting.
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` are passed to Claude when set, so a relocated Claude Code configuration and TLS-inspecting proxies work. Logins through `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` remain unsupported.
- For development: `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_DEV_PI` selects the npm-installed Pi that checks and tests use, `npm run capture:claude-breakpoints` inspects prompt-cache markers without using quota, and the paid release gate adds Haiku and image-cache stages.

### Changed

- Claude now starts in Pi's session working directory, the project Pi's tools work in, instead of a private temporary directory. Private request files stay separate, and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_GIT_INSTRUCTIONS=1` stops Claude Code's startup Git status collection, so a project's Git filters don't run. If that directory is deleted while Pi is running, requests fail with `working_directory`; restart Pi from an existing directory.
- Conversations with images now reuse Claude's prompt cache, because each image keeps the same private path for the whole Pi session. The 20-image and size limits are unchanged.
- The first request after upgrading builds a fresh prompt cache, because the transcript format is now `pi-claude-code-provider-context-v4`.
- The minimum supported Claude Code version is now 2.1.270. Older versions still run, and `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor` flags them.
- `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor` prints one fact per line.
- Pi's startup `[Extensions]` list shows `pi-claude-code-provider` instead of `pi-claude-code-provider:pi-claude-code-provider.ts`.
- The package summary on npm and pi.dev now reads: "The convenience of your Claude subscription in Pi, with the fewest possible surprises. Uses Claude Code's CLI under the hood."
- Web-search rate-limit errors include the overage-disabled reason, as provider requests already did.
- A Pi `modelOverrides` entry with a missing or non-positive `contextWindow` now fails with `context_window` instead of skipping the context check. The provider's own models are unaffected.
- Invalid request content, for example from another extension's payload hook, reports `content_shape`, `content_type`, or an image error category instead of `payload_invalid`.
- An image request fails with `image_path` if the temporary directory's path contains a double quote; point `TMPDIR` (or `TEMP` on Windows) at another directory.

### Fixed

- On Claude Code 2.1.268 and later, Claude no longer proposes tool calls into the provider's private directory, which made those calls fail.
- Prompt caching works again on Claude Code 2.1.268 and later: later turns reuse about 97–99% of the conversation instead of rewriting it.
- Large system prompts, for example from many skills or context files, are no longer refused by a fixed 120 KiB limit; only the model's context window applies ([#4](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/issues/4)).
- Pi tools whose names contain characters such as `.` no longer make every request fail with `isolation_tools`.
- Pi no longer stalls while a large tool call, such as a big `write`, streams in, and the call preview fills in as it arrives.
- A rate-limit warning that looks the same is shown once per session instead of on every tool round trip.
- Error messages include a short, path-redacted excerpt of Claude Code's error output instead of up to 64 KiB of it.
- Web search no longer counts discarded partial messages against its 2 MiB output limit.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-05

### Removed

- **Breaking.** Removed the `default` model alias. It sent no `--model` flag, so the served model was chosen by Claude Code account state that varies between accounts — observed as Sonnet on one and Opus on another — and never reflected the model selected in the user's own Claude Code settings, which this provider does not load. Pi reports an unknown model for a saved `pi --model pi-claude-code-provider/default` or profile entry.

### Added

- `/pi-claude-code-provider-doctor` and the diagnostic report name the model each alias resolves to, without consuming subscription quota. Values that cannot be read report `unavailable` and never affect model selection.
- Minimum supported Pi and Claude Code versions in `README.md`, reported by the doctor. They are advisory: an older installation is not blocked and may still run.
- `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_ACKNOWLEDGED_PLATFORM` suppresses one named platform's startup advisory without changing its verification status ([#3](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/3)).
- `npm run capture:claude-surface`, which captures `claude --help` verbatim for the capability tests.

### Changed

- The verified baseline advances to Pi 0.85.1 and Claude Code 2.1.261, and CI installs the Pi version the baseline names.
- macOS is recognized as verified on both architectures, with community-reported live coverage recorded in `DEVELOPING.md` ([#2](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/2)). It no longer raises a startup platform advisory.
- The paid model matrix asserts model families instead of dated model ids, so upstream model refreshes no longer fail it.
- `DESIGN.md` records what Claude Code adds to the model's view that this package cannot remove, the effect of dropping the user's Claude Code setting sources, and why the prompt-cache setting is pinned.

### Fixed

- Preflight no longer decides whether the provider can run by scraping `claude --help` for `--system-prompt-file`, which is documented but absent from the help screen. A minimum supported version covers it instead.
- npm Pi installations whose CLI lives in `dist/bundle/cli.js` resolve by locating the owning package rather than assuming its depth ([#2](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/2)).
- Paid validation is isolated from personal Pi settings, extensions, skills, and context files without moving user files ([#2](https://github.com/chem/pi-claude-code-provider/pull/2)).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Restore prompt-cache reuse broken by Claude Code 2.1.233's undocumented, changing token reminder. The provider now applies the maintainer-recommended `totalTokensReminder: "off"` setting; the cache gate verifies reuse across fresh processes.
- Honor Pi's per-request output limit, including compact 2,048-token branch-summary requests, while clamping it to the model maximum and reserving the same amount in context checks.
- Fail clearly on sanitized MCP initialization errors, malformed provider-hook payloads, near-match CLI options, oversized in-flight bridge requests, and process-tree termination failures. Cleanup errors now preserve the original failure, settle promptly, and retain the owned marker when process liveness is unknown.

### Changed

- Simplify transport guidance and child configuration, report bridge launches as structured argument vectors, and share Claude protocol/runtime helpers across provider, search, diagnostics, and tests.
- Update the verified baseline to Pi 0.84.2 and Claude Code 2.1.241.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Launch the proposal bridge through Pi's actual host runtime. Standalone Pi builds now use their embedded Bun runtime with a neutral pinned `bunfig.toml`, fixing tool proposals and preventing working-directory preload configuration.

### Added

- Add a real bridge handshake to the doctor and diagnostic report.
- Add npm and standalone bridge live gates, selectable with `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_PI_BIN`.

### Changed

- Include dates in rate-limit reset notices.
- Add resolved bridge and bounded stderr context to MCP startup failures.
- Diagnose standalone Pi as a supported runtime but unsupported development host.
- Verify Pi 0.84.2, Claude Code 2.1.237, and standalone Pi on Linux x64.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Report a rate limit only when one constrains the request. A rejected overage no longer overrides a healthy plan window, so a subscription with usage credits disabled at the account level no longer warns on every request, and the reported window name and utilization are preserved.
- Report each distinct rate-limit notice once per session rather than once per Claude process, which this transport starts for every tool round-trip.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Add `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MCP_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` to override the five-second MCP tool-catalog readiness timeout.

### Changed

- Verify the existing `opus` alias resolves to Claude Opus 5, retain its safe 200K Pro context limit, and update the verified baseline to Pi 0.84.1 and Claude Code 2.1.226.
- Improve provider and web-search rate-limit notifications with whole-percent utilization, reset times, and overage status.
- Align with Pi's provider lifecycle: stream partial responses as `pending` and invoke and await `after_provider_response` observers before publishing content.

### Fixed

- Improve web-search cancellation and cleanup: do not launch Claude for a pre-cancelled request, and recover stale private output left by abrupt exits.
- Tolerate newer Claude Code result, stop-reason, and advisory rate-limit envelopes while preserving useful error diagnostics.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

Initial public release.
