// cloned session, and clears its extension cache on reload or a change of working
// directory, which re-evaluates this module. An SDK host that shares one resource
// loader across sessions shares the extension instances with them. A map held in
// module scope would therefore let one evaluation's sessions be invisible to
// another's, and state held in a factory's closure would serve whichever session
// registered last, because Pi's model runtime keeps only the newest provider.

/**
 * The working directory stated for this request, or undefined when the prompt
 * names none. Best effort by construction, and two declaration forms are
 * recognized: a `<cwd>` section, which is what Pi itself renders, and a trailing
 * `Current working directory:` line, which a direct or upstream caller may author
 * for a session this package never registered. Both arrive here the same way,
 * recovered from the transcript's system messages, because Pi folds a caller's
 * prompt into them verbatim. An extension that forces the system prompt can omit
 * cwd entirely.
 *
 * Both readings take the *last* statement, and that is load-bearing rather than
 * incidental. Pi renders project context -- the repository's own instruction
 * files, which this provider does not author -- ahead of the directory, so
 * matching the last section and anchoring the trailing line to the end of the
 * prompt is what keeps a repository from naming the directory Claude
 * runs in. Preferring an earlier match would hand that choice to project files:
 * directly for a request whose session is unknown, where this is the only source
 * of truth, and as a refusal for one whose session is known, where a disagreeing
 * prompt fails the request.
 *
 * Ordering alone is a defense this package cannot verify, though: it holds only
 * while Pi keeps rendering project context first, and a change there would be
 * silent. A section nested inside a project-context element is therefore
 * discarded outright, whatever its position, and the last-match rule stays as the
 * second line of defense rather than the only one.
